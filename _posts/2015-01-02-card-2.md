<a href="http://www.orangestreet.biz/" target="_blank">Orange Street Software</a> specializes in outsourced IT services for medium to enterprise businesses.

For the period of my contract with them I was outsourced to Picardi Rebel as an ICT manager, where I founded and headed a project to enable remote desktop access to the existing DOS POS network. 

This was to assist the business in its reporting capacity as they were previously unable to get stock / financial reports from stores in real time.

This aided the business greatly in it's decision making as they could now control stock levels / sales reports centrally and in real time.

A national rollout followed (+-80 stores) where I visited almost every store, in order to complete the project within the tight 3 month deadline specified by management.

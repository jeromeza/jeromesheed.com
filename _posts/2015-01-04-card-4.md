<a href="http://www.parcelperfect.com/" target="_blank">Adept Software</a> creates software catering for the logistics / courier industries.

I worked as a IT Support Engineer. My work was primarily done over the phone via the IT help desk, but I did occasionally go out on-site, in order to train and assist clients in person.

I supported Adept's software packages. These include Parcel Perfect, PPSms, PPMobile and PPImager.

I assisted customers in the installation / operation of the above packages. 

I also administered the Linux servers (Redhat derivatives. Fedora and CentOS). This entailed maintenance of the above software packages, Firebird SQL and data backups.

### Duties Included:

* Firebird SQL usage to interrogate data for clients and retrieve information they needed.
* SQL DB backups / restore's.
* QA / Bug testing
* Client visits
* Inhouse software support
